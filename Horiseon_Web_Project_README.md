This website was created to finesse HTML skills and CSS positioning, design and class structure. 
The key changes made were:
- Colour changes to create a more unified feel
- Stuctural adjustments
- The addition of sections and alt attributes to images for structure and accessibility
- Fixing non-working links (id attribution)
- Font siszing adjustments
All elements and assets are contained within this repo: the core HTML, CSS Stylesheet and associated visual assets.
